                        In a society where populations without social media can be massively underrepresented, 
                        many lack voices that they deserve to have. Through our platform, those more privileged 
                        can better understand what hardships homeless people face on a daily basis.

                        Our idea allows volunteers throughout Seattle to go out and find stories from homeless people. 
                        From tough experiences to fun jokes, people will be more connected when they find more perspectives
                        from someone new. No matter who you're talking to, you can be motivated, inspired, and gain a deeper 
                        understanding of the human experience.

                        We envision that society will be better educated about the underrepresented people around them. 
                        Through this, we will increase funding for homeless people, and in partnership with other 
                        Seattle homeless programs, we can tackle homelessness in an overall effort to keep people safe,
                        sheltered, and set for a better future.

                    <p>
                        Our founders have personally interacted with homeless people numerous times in public spaces.
                        Through these times, we've realized that these people have stories to tell that can influence
                        millions of people. We want these stories to be heard, while also bringing the Seattle community
                        closer together.
